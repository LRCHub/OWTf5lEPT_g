Think, think for a moment
Just how you ended up here
The streets, tattered and broken
Just like when you look in the mirror

The silence is sounding
Persistently pounding
Away at your mind
The tempest is growing
As tears begin flowing
And you become blind

See with your eyes just how
You realized that your
Efforts were in vein
Holding your head to
Contain all the dread but
Unknown to you is the architect
Who Created the lies
Over-analyzing and
Amplifying the pain
Looping the wrongs and
Forgetting the rights when you've
Yet to open your eyes

So think, think for a moment
Just how you got where you are
New sights to build your devotion
And this is a good place to start
